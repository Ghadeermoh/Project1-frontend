1-we try to find repeated things in each section
section h2 ,section opacity effect on buttons , section padding ,website elements in container.

c+tab ---comment

to use icons we use font awesome library and take font folder from it and paste it beside the Css folder.
we copy "font awesome.min.css" and put beside my css file i use in project.

then from website "https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icon" we copy code of icon we need to add.

we  can use awesome version 5 also in same way.

to select fonts used in website we use inspect and take font , we use in google font website and copy code.
we have to parts we add one in the head and the other in css file after calling body.

box-sizing: border-box; ------>this property used to inform code that padding and margin does not affect width 
when we apply.
padding will take from width i has gived.


to prevent image from being draggable by anyone we use:
<img src="images/logo.webp" alt="logo image" draggable="false"/>

to solve float problems we use clear class after last element take float 
use overflow hidden for parent of the elements take float but we try to use specific class not used in other things.

we add padding to list items using <a> tag instead of <li> to made all the area of text likable 
but first we have to change <a> elements to display block to have padding from all sides.

---------------------------part2---------------------------------------------------------

for doing text with image packground ---------->we use background image in css 
for image without text ----------->use html

difference ----option save image as.

it is prefered to giva all elements class 
do not write capital in html.

we give buttons two classes 

we can note that home take view port hight 100% from screen.
height: 100vh; 

after adding background image we can change its position using "background-position: center;" or "background-size: cover;".
then we try to add black frame on the image using position.

RGBA ----------->background color 
RGB -----for color and A for obacity.
"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);"

we should put the content inside the overlay class as we can select it , when its behide the overlay we can not select it.


transition in opacity works in all things or properties in element not only opacity so we specify transition to opacity only
 

position fixed and absolute convert element from display block to inline-block.
so we convert header to position fixed and width 100% to display over the home page.

to show element which position is fixed and hidden beside another element use :
z-index: 10; 
--------------------------
using after and before in adding line under the nav bar content appears when I mouse hover on it.
after and before are inline elements.
.header .navbar li a::after{
    content: "";
    display:block ;
    width:0;     /* we give it width zero untill we hover*/
    height: 3px;
    background: blue;
}

.header .navbar li a:hover::after{    ----->means when i hover bring after element and add code to it.
width: 100%;
}


we use ">" to select li childs of navbar only not all li.and same thing for <a>.

overflow hidden we use for float problems affect dropdown to be invisible.so we use clear insted of this.

-------------------------------------------------------part3 -project-----------------------------------------------

first we add sections as the website using common things such as:
1-header in each section.
2-padding at the beginning of each section.
we can use padding section pd-y and give it to each section with padding value we need.
or we made a new div and give it class pd-y but with half the value of padding "cause the element will take padding from top and bottom".


we can use page ruler extention to calculate spaces between elements and decide padding and margin values.

when we create about setion with three items we change margin of middle item.

how to do black effect from left to right when hover :
we do general class "Ltr-effect"


we can use top:0 and bottom 0 to made width 100%

.Ltr-effect{
position: relative;    
}

.Ltr-effect::after{
position: absolute;
content: "";
width: 0%;
height: 100%;
background: #333;
z-index: -1;
top: 0%;
left: 0%;
transition: width .5S;
}

.Ltr-effect:hover::after{
    width: 100%;
}

how to add layer over the image and center text of it.using hero image.

I can do absolute element and move to absolute parent which is moving to relative one.

to put icon in the middle of the background element we use line-hight = heigh of back ground element.


we use transition delay to affect different transition on elements.

-----------------------------------------------part4-----------------------------------------------------------------
if i have an icon on the left side of div and fixed i can use position to do it.

to add bullets we can add <li> empty.


to move element in center of item we can give parent padding.

background-size:cover ;
background-attachment: fixed;

to fill contetn image existin , when scroll image fixed with me .


in case element take background even if it was white z-index =-1 is not working in LTR effect.
so we use this 
.team-item.Ttb-effect{
    z-index: 1;
}
